## Branching Approach

We are using the [Git Flow](https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/git-flow/) strategy.  
1. The `master` branch contains the latest release code.  
 **Only merge to `master` when the changes have been agreed ready for release.**
2. The `develop` branch (a child of `master`) is a staging area for changes to be included in a future release.
3. `feature`, `release`, and `hotfix` branches can be added as necessary, following the Git Flow principles.

## Pull Request Process

1. Link the pull request to the issue it addresses.
2. Ensure any changes include appropriate unit tests.
3. Update the [README](./README.md) where necessary.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of one other developer, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.
